## Note for automated testing
Test files are found in the test folder. Before testing, the user must comment necessary lines of code and uncomment others based on what is discussed in the handout(for the mock auth and fake db). Not doing so will result to failed tests.

## Things you did in the code
Basically I used all the things that I have learned from the previous lessons and exercises in this project. I used the codes from the handouts and also my previous exer to build some of the parts of my project. For the other parts, I studied them online and then build them up little by little.

## Challenges faced
I encountered many challenges while doing this project. First, I encountered a time when the app/tab would just keep on loading after switching and returning tabs. I also had a difficult time implementing the notifications.
